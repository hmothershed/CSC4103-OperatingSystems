# CSC4103-OperatingSystems
This repository is to hold all of my coding assignments from course CSC 4103

*Textbook: Operating System Concepts, 8.5th Edition or newer (Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne; 2008, 2011, or 2012).*

## Project 1 - Multithreading
You will implement the Project - Sudoku Solution Validator given in the textbook. Your program will need to validate whether a given Sudoku solution is correct or not. In your implementation, your program should create **at least 3 concurrent threads**, each of which validates a part of the Sudoku solution (a row, a column, or a subgrid). Use either **POSIX Pthreads** or **Java threads** to implement this program
